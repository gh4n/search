The project implements a simple search to find tickets and users by field.

-----------------------------------------

How do I run it?

Navigate the root of the directory build and tag the docker container

docker build -t zensearch .

Then run it

docker run zensearch

How does the search work?

An inverted index is constructed from each field and value of the input corpus. Consider the document below with id: 1

{
  "name": "saskia",
  "age": 1,
  "noises": [
    "meow",
    "purr",
    "sniff"
  ],
  "temperament": "agreeable",
  "coat": "short"
}

would look like this when indexed - each field and value key the document with those attributes

{
    name : {
        saskia: [1]
    },
    age: {
        1: [1]
    },
    noises: {
        meow: [1],
        purr: [1],
        sniff: [1]
    },
    temperament: {
        agreeable: [1]
    },
    coat: {
        short: [1]
    }
}

Let's add another document with id: 2

{   
    name: bo,
    age: 1,
    noises: [
        rawr,
        purr,
        yawn,
        meow
    ]
    temperament: skittish,
    coat: long
}

Now the index looks like this

{
    name : {
        saskia: [1]
        bo: [2]
    },
    age: {
        1: [1, 2]
    },
    noises: {
        meow: [1, 2],
        purr: [1, 2],
        sniff: [1],
        rawr: [2],
        yawn: [2],
    },
    temperament: {
        agreeable: [1],
        skittish: [2]
    },
    coat: {
        short: [1]
        long: [2]
    }
}

If we want to find all the cats who purr we simple return index[noises][purr] and we get documents 1 and 2. If we want to find all cats named saskia we return index[name][saskia] and we get document 1.
